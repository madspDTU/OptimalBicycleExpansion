# OptimalBicycleExpansion
Repository for societally optimal expansions of bicycle networks

The model is developed for the article "Societally optimal expansion of bicycle networks", currently under review in Transportation Research Part B: Methodological. Please cite as:

The project consists of four `R` files:
- `BicyclePrioritisation.R` - contains the main script for running the models
- `AnalysisPlots.R` - code for making relevant analysis and plots
- `SimilarityMeasures.R` - code for comparing approximated and properly calculated consumer surpluses
- `BP_HelperFunctions.R` - code containing essential functions called by `BicyclePrioritisations.R`.
